<h1>Project: Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
<h2><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>
<li>I completed the basic functions of the game as was asked on the Odin Project website. Maybe I will try to make it interactive with HTML buttons and other things.</li>
<li>I will probably come back to this project after finishing the 'smartautogreenhouse project'</li>

<strong>Tips:</strong>
<li>(return - returns the results to the used function)</li>
<li>(.toLowerCase() - makes letters lowercase, this converts uppercase letters)</li>
<li>(in HTML; from past research, people say to put Javascript <script src=""></script> at the bottom since it works better; if the HTML page loads the other information first, I think)</li>
<li>Write more comments that describe why you did something, incase you forget

<strong>TODOS:</strong>
<ul><s>1. Make span id change with JavaScript (maybe getelementbyid + inner html since the text will only change)</s></ul>
<ul><s>2. Figure out what previous written JS code does. (Using console.log)</s></ul>
<ul><s>3. Each time the player chooses a choice, the computer does at the same time. (5 total)</s></ul>
<ul><s>4. Need results for winning / losing / draw + don't use for / loops, just use if else elseif conditions to make less complicated</s></ul>
<ul><s>5. It would be easier to complete the main functions through JavaScript but, its easier for me to figure things out visually faster; if I combine it with the button all together. (I was wrong, it was faster without)</s></ul>
<ul><s>7. The functions will trigger when a button is pressed / type with alert prompt maybe?</ul></s></ul>
