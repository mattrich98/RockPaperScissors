 <h2>Project: Rock Paper Scissors</h2>
<br> 
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<li>(return - returns the results to the used function)</li>
<li>(.toLowerCase() - makes letters lowercase, this converts uppercase letters)</li>
<li>(in HTML; from past research, people say to put Javascript <script src=""></script> at the bottom since it works better; if the HTML page loads the other information first, I think)</li>
<br>
<strong>TODOS:</strong>
<ul>1. Make span id change with JavaScript (maybe getelementbyid)</ul>
<ul>2. Figure out what previous written JS code does. (Using console.log) </ul>
<ul>3. Each time the player chooses a choice, the computer does at the same time. (5 total)</ul>
<ul>4. Need results for winning / losing / draw</ul>
<ul>5. It would be easier to complete the main functions through JavaScript but, its easier for me to figure things out visually faster; if I combine it with the button all together.</ul>
<ul>6. Do CSS last as its the least important / not necessary</ul>
<ul>7. The functions will trigger when a button is pressed / type with alert prompt maybe?</ul>
